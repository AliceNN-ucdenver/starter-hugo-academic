event_url: https://membership.anitab.org/event/Recommender_Day2

location: Zoom

summary: This online workshop consists of presentations & labs covering the fundamental techniques & tools for building highly effective recommender systems from matrix based recommender systems to wide & deep network models.  
abstract: 'Day 2: 
Day 2: Training Wide and Deep Recommenders (120 mins)
* Build a wide and deep network using TensorFlow 2:
* Build a deep network using Keras.
* Build a wide and deep network using TensorFlow feature columns.
* Efficiently ingest training data with NVTabular data loaders.
Break (15 mins)
Day 2: Challenges of Deploying Recommendation Systems to Production (120 mins)
* Deploy a recommender system in a production environment:
* Acquire a trained model configuration for deployment.
* Build a container for deployment.
* Deploy the trained model using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server.
Day 2: Final Review (15 mins)
* Review key learnings and answer questions.
* Learn to build your own training environment from the DLI base environment container.
* Complete the assessment and earn a certificate.
